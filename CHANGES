Sippy Cup Changelog
===================

Version 0.5.2
-------------
- fixed a bug where QUERY_STRING was initialized as None instead of an empty
  string. This would break things like Flask's request.args.get('something')
  if no query params were in the request

Version 0.5.1
-------------
- added support / workaround for setting multiple cookies

Version 0.5
-----------
- added support for Python 3.6 (Thanks to PJ Santoro! -
  https://github.com/abigperson/)
- use API Gateway's resource path when configuring WSGI environment's
  SCRIPT_NAME and PATH_INFO in order to support nested resources
- hide accountId in demo app
- added CloudFormation template to provision AWS resources required for
  setting up demo app
- support for specifying SCRIPT_NAME so that redirection and URL generation
  work as expected when base path mapping is being used in API Gateway. This
  is done by setting a stage variable named SIPPYCUP_SCRIPT_NAME_BASE. See
  README for additional details.
